1. Example Description
    PIN PTD15 - toggled using Gpio_Dio_Ip driver and configure other pins using Port_Ci_Port_Ip driver (Pins tool)
    1.1 The application software functionality
        PIN control with write channel

2. Installation steps
    2.1 Hardware installation
        2.1.1 Supported boards
            - S32K116EVB2-Q048
        2.1.2 Connections
            Power Adapter 12V (J107.1 - J107.2) or micro-USB (J107.2 - J107.3)
            PTE8 (J111.2 - J111.3) is controlling the LED (wired on board) - when output state set to high, the LED turns on and vice versa.
        2.1.3 Debugger
            The micro-USB must be connected to J7 (USB port)

3. Generating, building and running the example application
    3.1 Generating the S32 configuration
        Before running the example, a configuration needs to be generated. First go to Project Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project. Select the "S32 Configuration Tool" menu then click on the desired configuration tool (Pins, Cocks, Peripherals etc...). Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components. Make the desired changes (if any) then click on the "S32 Configuration Tool->Update Code" button.
    3.2 Compiling the application
        Select the configuration to be built: FLASH (Debug_FLASH) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the build button in eclipse.
        Use Project > Build to build the project.
        Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step. Check the compiler console for error messages; upon completion, the *.elf binary file should be created.
    3.3 Running the application on the board
        Go to Run and select Debug Configurations. There will be a debug configuration for this project:

        Configuration Name                                 Description
        -----------------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------
        Gpio_Dio_Ip_Example_S32K118_Debug_FLASH_PNE        Debug the FLASH configuration using P&E

        Select the desired debug configuration and click on Launch. Now the perspective will change to the Debug Perspective.
        Use the controls to control the program flow.
